% Input:
%   traj_probs: probability of states per trajectory, per waypoint
%       3dim matrix with size (num_sampled_traj, num_waypoints)
%   epsilon: sampled noise per trajectory, per waypoint, per joint
%       3dim matrix with size (num_sampled_traj, num_waypoints, num_joints)
% Output:
%   dtheta: delta theta per joint, per waypoint
%       2dim matrix with size (num_joints, num_waypoints)
